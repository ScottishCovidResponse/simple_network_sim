"""
This script will create a compartmental transition rates file as required by simple_network_sim
from a number of direct epidemiological parameters, some age-stratified by the ages "[0,17)", "[17,70)", "70+"
- asymptomatic-period: expected length of pre-symptomatic period for an individual who will eventually devleop symptoms
- death-before-hospitalised: age-structured probability of death from symptomatic state, without being hospitalised
- death-in-hospital: age-structured probability of death given hospitalisation
- hospital-stay: expected length of a hospital stay in hours
- hospitalisation-from-symptoms: age-structured probability that an individual with symptoms will require hospitalisation
- infectious-duration: expected period in which an individual with symptoms is infectious after symptoms appear, in hours
- infectious-period-asymptomatics: expected time period during which true asymptomatics are infectious in hours
- latent-period: expected latent period in hours
- symptom-probability: age-structured probability of an exposed individual eventually developing symptoms (as opposed to being truly asymptomatic)
movement-to-work aggregated files at the Scottish Datazone and Intermediate Zone levels, using:
These are assumed to be accessible via the data_pipeline_api.data_processing_api, as described in the file data_processing_config.yaml
Python requirements:
- pathlib
- pandas
- data_pipeline_api
How to run this module:
```
This script can be run with
```
python generating_rates_from_epidemiological_params.py
```
The script generates a .h5 file of compartment transition rates, in the location specified in  data_processing_config.yaml
