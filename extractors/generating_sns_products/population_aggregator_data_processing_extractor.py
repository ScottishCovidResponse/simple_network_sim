"""
This package will create the row-wise table of health board population numbers needed by simple_network_sim basing itself in the following data:

- The Scottish demographics (NRS): ftp://boydorr.gla.ac.uk/scrc/human/demographics/scotland/1.0.0.h5

How to run this module:
Assuming you have your environment setup with conda, this script can be run with

```
python population_aggregator_data_processing_extractor.py
```
That will generate a file called check_pop_table.csv (for convenient sanity-checking), and a .h5 file with the same information for use
inside the simple network sim model at generated_sns_products/population_healthboards_scotland
(https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/simple_network_sim)
