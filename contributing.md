# Contributing

> **Rule 0:** Be polite, respectful and supportive.

At present, contributions are limited to members of Scottish COVID-19 Response Consortium (SCRC). The process for implementing changes is:
- An **issue** is raised in the [SCRC issue tracking repository](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/SCRCIssueTracking), tagged "Simple Network Sim"
> *How to write a good issue:* Check for duplicate issues - don't raise the same issue twice! Be specific - whoever works on this needs to know where it ends. Not too big - if the issue could be multiple issues, it probably should be.
- The **issue** is assigned (ideally self assigned with the agreement of the team) to a team member (assignee)
- The assignee creates a **branch** to work on the issue
- The assignee makes a series of **commits** to the branch, implementing changes that address the issue
- The assignee makes a **pull request**, requesting a **review** (a review is required to merge, and a request lets the team member know to do a review)
> *How to do a good pull request:* Tie it to usually one or sometimes more issues - e.g. write 'resolves ScottishCovidResponse/SCRCIssueTracking#1'. This will automatically mark the issue as closed when the pull request is merged. Summarise what you've done to resolve the issue(s).

**For the time being, all pull requests should be reviewed by a repository admin.**
- The assignee (or reviewer) merges the pull request into the `master` branch
