This file is to list the things to do and features we need to add.

Tasks:
Exception and malformed input robustness in master branch (and everything thereafter)
Finding and formatting movement data between regions
Testing of internal node state work
Find all parameters - hardcoded, etc.  Move to reading from a file
Any documentation of existing undocumented functions
Start a HowTo
Finish node internal age/state
Consider parameterisation - investigate Bayesian fitting frameworks - ABrox? pyABC?
Hand parameterise for a reasonable run?
Aim: get it to run with areas as with RK model- needs data plus parameters
Visualisation: code for nicer model output visualisation
Visualisation: code for nicer model *map* output visualisation
Reading and writing: code to make useful log files
Reading and writing: code to read various file types (look up SCRC file format)
Modelling Scenarios: movement dampening 
Modelling Scenarios: school scenarios
Modelling Scenarios: produce disobedience
