## Notebooks

Several notebooks are available for providing examples and analysis of the outputs of the model, as well as inference.

[Example: Loading and running model](Example Loading and running model.ipynb) shows a simple example of how to load and run the model with the default parameters.

[Parameter sensitivity analysis](Parameter sensitivity analysis.ipynb) analyses the sensitivity of the model to small changes to model parameters.

[Non-linear parameter sensitivity](Non-linear parameter sensitivity.ipynb) attempts at analysing the non-linear interactions between the model parameters, as well as more advanced model explanation tools such as SHAP.

[Inference: ABC SMC](Inference ABC SMC.ipynb) shows how to run the inference, and provides analysis of the outputs of the inference.
