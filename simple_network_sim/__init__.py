Simple network sim is a network-based model for disease outbreak modeling. This package was writing specially for the
COVID-19 pandemic of 2019/2020.

The main model is the `network_of_populations`, which connects regions. The `network_of_individuals` model is not
completed and, currently, it's entirely commented out. However, its goal would be to connect people instead of regions.
