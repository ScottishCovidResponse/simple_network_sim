"""
This package implements the network of populations simulation. This models regions as nodes with intra node rules and
different inter node transmission rules. The end result of the model is a timeseries of the number of people in each
node, compartment and age.

The compartments and age groups are defined in the inputs for the model. The only hardcoded compartment are:

1. Susceptibles (S) -- people who are not immune to the disease and can catch it at any moment.
2. Exposed (E) -- people who already have the disease, whoever do not yet show symptoms and do not yet infectious.

The main type of this module is the `NetworkOfPopulation` class, which is a data object with all the data needed to run
the model. The main entrypoint function for the simulation is :meth:`basicSimulationInternalAgeStructure`. That function
will run a simulation based on the data in the `NetworkOfPopulation` instance and it will output a pandas DataFrame
with disease progression over time. Just like most public functions in this module, it does not make changes to the
objects passed as inputs.
