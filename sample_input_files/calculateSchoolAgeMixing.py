# This script is simultaneously poorly written and overengineered.
# I expected to have to do some complicated interpolation of school locations into
# health boards before I saw that health boards are a super set of local authorities ant
# that local authorities are not scplit across health boards - thus the overengineering.
# The poorly written part has no excuse.....

# NOTE:
# We need the following spreadsheet because it contains data on each school's capacity in each local authority
# https://www2.gov.scot/Resource/0054/00548378.xlsx

# between classes in a school the mixing (ave number of contacts a pupil will have in a school) is
# 30*1.0 + (school_size-30)*0.6
# and multiplying this by the number of pupils in the school will give the number of contacts within the school.

# The number of contacts between schools in a local authority, assuming that the contact rate is 5%, is
# 0.5 * 0.05 * (number of pupils in local authority - number pupils in the school)

# The number of contacts is presented as the average number of contacts a school age child will have as a 
# fraction (percentage) of the size of the school.
