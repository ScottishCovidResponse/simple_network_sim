# simple_network_sim
Adaptation of a simple network simulation model to COVID-19
*TODO: Expand this section.*
## Contributing
At present, contributions are limited to members of Scottish COVID-19 Response Consortium (SCRC). The process for implementing changes is:
- An **issue** is raised in the [SCRC issue tracking repository](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/SCRCIssueTracking), tagged "Simple Network Sim"
- The **issue** is assigned (ideally self assigned with the agreement of the team) to a team member (assignee)
- The assignee creates a **branch** to work on the issue
- The assignee makes a series of **commits** to the branch, implementing changes that address the issue
- The assignee makes a pull request, requesting a review (a review is required to merge, and a request lets the team member know to do a review) 
**For the time being, all pull requests must be reviewed by @magicicada.**
- The assignee (or reviewer) merges the pull request into the `master` branch
